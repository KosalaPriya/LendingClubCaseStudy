## General Information
This Project is about giving suggestions to the investors who is ready to fund the borrowers via lending club data.
Based on the suggestions the investors should be able to decide whether they need to fund the requested borrower or not. 
The lending club have provided the data to us, to do the analysis from which the suggestions can be derived.
The business problem what the client facing here is the chances of giving loan to the wrong persons who will never pay the loan are high ie providing loan to the defaulters.
And also the chances of not giving loan to the right person may result in loss of business for the investors.
The data set we used to analysis this issue is the loan.csv file which has the history of previously loan availed borrowers data
